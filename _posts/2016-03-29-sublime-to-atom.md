I really like sublime editor but wanted to try atom and know why it is so much popular. While doing coding in atom, I find many things which were not user friendly (_compare to sublime_) like:

- no highlight word occurences when a word is selected.
- By default, everything looked dark. It was hard to see switch through tabs because of light reflection on my mac.

But I overcome the above drawbacks by installing plugins (_which were so easy to install_)

Here are some features which I like in atom:

- open source (_yeah, no more popups to say purchase the license_)
- apm package manager (_you can install plugins same as npm in command prompt_)
- monokai theme (`apm install monokai-seti`)
- [Create your own packages](http://www.sitepoint.com/write-atom-packages-using-vanilla-javascript/)
- highlight-selected plugin (select all occurrences like in Sublime)
- inbuilt git commands (for more git commands, install `git-plus`)
- Fun plugins (activate-power-mode)

PS: It seems for every install of new plugin, we need to restart this editor.
