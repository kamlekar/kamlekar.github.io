I like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) editor but wanted to try [Atom](https://atom.io/) and know why it is so much popular. While doing coding in atom, I find many things which were not user friendly (_compare to sublime_) like:

- No highlight word occurences when a word is selected.
- By default, everything looked dark. It was hard to see and switching through tabs because of light reflection on my Mac.

But I overcome the above drawbacks by installing plugins and themes (_which were so easy to install_)

Here are some features which I like in Atom:

- open source (_yeah, no more popups to say purchase the license_)
- `apm` package manager (_you can install plugins same as npm in command prompt_)
- Monokai theme (`apm install monokai-seti`)
- [Create your own packages](http://www.sitepoint.com/write-atom-packages-using-vanilla-javascript/)
- [Highlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected) plugin (helps to select all occurrences like in Sublime)
- Inbuilt git commands (for more git commands, install `git-plus`)
- Fun plugins ([activate-power-mode](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode))

PS: It seems for every install of new plugin, we need to restart this editor.
