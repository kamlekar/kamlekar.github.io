<p>If someone is new to any technology then everything looks dim to him/her. Many people don't know where to start. For those people I would like to suggest to go through following steps for understanding slowly. I am not saying that it must be strictly follow. These are the steps which I always follow when learning any new technology.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go through the official website of that technology.</li>
<li>Go through video tutorials provided by the official site or youtube.</li>
<li>Always keep API documentation page open.</li>
<li>Know the authors/developers of that technology and go through their sites or articles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some good tutorial sites which might help you to get start:</p>
<ul>
<li>www.tutsplus.com/</li>
<li>www.smashingmagazine.com</li>
<li>www.sitepoint.com</li>
<li>www.siteground.com/tutorials</li>
</ul>
<p>For assistance when you got any issues, ask for help on following sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forums provided by the official site.(if any)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stackexchange.com">Stackexchange</a> sites like <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">stackoverflow</a>.</li>
</ul>
