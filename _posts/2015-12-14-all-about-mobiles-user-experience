###What features to see?
Most people are confused on which feature to see when buying a mobile. I will list out some features/specifications which one must look in while buying a mobile:

- **GPU Speed:**
- **Chipset:**
- **RAM:**
- **ROM:**
- **Video:**
- **Primary and Secondary camera:**
- **Flash LED light:**
- **Water proof:**
- **4G:**
- **WIFI:**
- **FM Radio:**
- **Dual Sim:** Not necessarily it should be Dual SIM but having so is preferred by many people (_including me_).
- **GPS:**
- **Screen type (LED/LCD):**
- **Expandable memory:**
- **Quick charge:**

Apart from the above mentioned features there are some specific things which every user wants in there phone and these things can be seen in reviews but not in specifications. 

- **Heating:**
- **Lagging:**
- **Battery discharging speed:**

###Some extra awesome features:

From the above mentioned features, there should be some wow features which I think are necessary:

- **Physical keyboard with trackpad:** Currently, this feature is provided by Blackberry in mobiles like BB Priv, BB Passport and BB Classic.
