###What features to see?
Most people are confused on which feature to see when buying a mobile. I will list out some features/specifications which one must look in while buying a mobile:

- **GPU Speed:**
- **Chipset:**
- **RAM:**
- **ROM:**
- **Video:** Frames per second and video lens quality.
- **Primary and Secondary camera:** This is a must to have features these days where Primary camera is used for #selfies and Secondary camera to record videos.
- **Flash LED light:** A must to have feature to capture great quality photos in dark. This feature can also be used as Torch light when you are struck in dark.
- **Water proof:**
- **4G:**
- **WIFI:**
- **FM Radio:**
- **Dual Sim:** Not necessarily it should be Dual SIM but having so is preferred by many people (_including me_).
- **GPS:**
- **Screen type (LED/LCD):**
- **Expandable memory:**
- **Quick charge:**

Apart from the above mentioned features there are some specific things which every user wants in there phone and these things can be seen in reviews but not in specifications. 

- **Heating:**
- **Lagging:**
- **Sound quality:**
- **Battery discharging speed:**
- **Slippery:**

###Some extra awesome features:

From the above mentioned features, there should be some wow features which I think are necessary:

- **Physical keyboard with trackpad:** Currently, this feature is provided by Blackberry in mobiles like BB Priv, BB Passport and BB Classic.
- **Trackpad or Motion sensor:** Having just motion sensor without a physical keyboard also will be count as awesome feature. 
- **Wireless charging:**
- **Curved Edge Screen:**
- **3D Touch:** Currently, this is provided in iPhone 6S.
- **Finger print Scanner:**
- **One touch camera:** I believe there should be a button on mobile which is when I press, I will jump to Camera mode even when the Mobile is locked (_there should be some kind of finger print scanner to quickly access the capture_).

###What kind of Mobile I like?

I personally like to have all the above mentioned features in one mobile and also the screen size of the mobile should not be more than 4-Inch (yes, you heard it right). I don't need a large screen mobile because I believe that even a 4 Inch mobile is enough large to watch videos and browse Internet. I don't care what kind of OS my mobile is running on until all the latest apps are supported.

Clearly, this is not possible. Not in present generation. So, I think we are not yet in Modern era where we can have a [custom mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Ara) which suits our requirement (i.e., I NEED EVERYTHING).
