<p>Here I am not against any religion. This is a wake up call to Hindus. So, if you are a non-hindu don't read this article because it is not useful for you.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:  I am not talking bad against other religions here. Peace :)</p>
<p>I am seeing most of the Hindus are following other religion cultures like</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting cakes on special occasions like Birthdays or functions</li>
<li>Celebrating new year of Christian calendar but not Hindus calendar (Ugadi)</li>
<li>Celebrating Christmas</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, you are right, we are slowly starting to follow Christian culture.</p>
<p>Why not just follow your own culture? which is Hindu culture.</p>
<p>To give you a small summary, Hindu culture a.k.a "Sanathana Dharma" is an ancient one and is being practiced from more than 17 lakh years ago (the number 17 lakh is the proven year by NASA by founding Adam's bridge a.k.a Ram Sethu. I don't want to go in details about this now).</p>
<p>So, you might be getting the following doubts now:</p>
<p><strong>What should I do on my Birthday then?</strong><br />
<code>Well, according to Hindu culture, one must take blessings from elders on their Birthday. and also donate food or clothes to the poor people.</code></p>
