**She** was standing in front of me, across the wide street. I saw her after a long time. Though she is far, I can see that she is seeing me with a smile on her beautiful face. She want to say something to me. ..or maybe that's my hallucination. One part of me says - "Why she is back?" Another part says - "Why she is seeing me?" But most of my part wants to be in that moment forever. I can make our relation go further by proposing her but I am afraid she may get surprised and I might lose her forever. I am dumb to think so, but my heart dominates my brain in this matter.

She is crossing the street to come by my side. suddenly, a SUV came at her side,  screeching its tyres to stop the speed moving hulk at once. Something is happening there. I can see some guys came out of the SUV and started to forcibly move her, to abduct her. A sudden sense in my body, shaking me down from head to toe. I wasn't expecting this on a routine normal day. I don't know what to do, I was feeling helpless. I must do something.. I don't know them, maybe they are from her past. I don't give a damn about them. I must protect her. Everyone was watching the scene as a movie is going on. No one was doing anything. I decided not to be one of those guys. I saw a guy next to me, watching the incident across the street, who might have just came by playing cricket. I snatched bat from his hand to fight against them. I don't know how I can beat those five SUV guys with a bat.. I don't give a damn.. I must do it. I crossed the road quickly and spin my hand in attempt to hit a guy who was forcing her. Before I could hit him, suddenly, I felt a blow on back of my head and I fell on the ground.. a blow which can kill a guy easily.. but not me.. I have to protect her first. I can see they succeed to get her inside the SUV. I can see that.. SUV started moving.. I am still on the ground.. people around us are caring about me but not about the leaving SUV.. I must not give up.. I might lose her forever.. I stood.. staggering like hell. I fell down again.

I am in middle of nowhere, thinking that I might have died.. but I must not.. I must protect her first.. I can see an angel coming towards me, flying. She is the angel. She gives a kiss on my forehead. A kiss.. which is a leverage to everything in this world. The kiss which makes me do miracles. A leverage so powerful that I can create an impossible wonder or destroy the world, for her. 

I woke up suddenly. I can barely feel myself. my whole body is numb. my heart beating as machine gun, thinking about her safety. The SUV is gone, I don't know where it went. I don't want to give up.. A kid, around ten year old, approached me and pointed me to the direction they went and offered me his bicycle. I can see the stalled SUV at the warehouse. It might sound funny to chase on a cycle, but again, I don't give a damn. 

I rode the cycle to the old warehouse. I still don't know how can I beat them.. the police might be on the way as I had seen some people calling, I hope they called the police. But I can't wait for police.. I must protect her. I entered the warehouse, I can hear her voice crying for help. I must act fast. I saw AK 47 gun, maybe it is one of those guys. I took it.. I don't know how to fire it. I started thinking about the game I play, counter-strike. there was safety pin on the gun, I made it off. I checked the cartridge, it was full of 30 bullets. I slowly moved in the area where they were trying to rape her. she protected herself till now, she was giving up. I aimed at them, making sure not to kill her in the assault, and started firing. I can barely handle the gun.. I was shooting somewhere else. They saw me and with attention they took out their guns to shoot me. She took the chance to move away from them. I saw it and re-aimed myself at them. They got hit by the shots on their arms and legs but not on head or chest, I was poor with aiming. I was out of ammo.. they were down.. maybe unconscious or dead. I can see one guy is moving for a gun which fortunately fall from his hand in one side shoot-out. Suddenly, she came by crying and hit him with a thing like rod and now he was down. My mission was completed.. I can feel again the cruciating pain on back of my head. I fell on the ground... while closing eyes I saw her crying my name and moving towards me.. I closed my eyes.

I opened my eyes.. to see myself in ICU. My head is wrapped with plaster.. I could barely move. I saw from the front glassed window, she is talking to the doctor, possibly concerning about me. she cares about me. She saw me that I was conscious and ran towards me, that felt good. She is crying with a smile on her face, I have never seen her like this before. Her eyes with full of water clearly says she loves me. She gives a damn about me. Now, I don't give a damn about the things which going to happen next because she is now with me.
